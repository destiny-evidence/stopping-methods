## Definitions
A Stopping Method is considered Target-agnostic if the decision to stop the Priority Screening process is not based on evaluating progress against a predefined performance goal for metrics like recall or precision. Instead, it might rely on factors such as exhausting a review budget (fixed number of items or time), observing simple patterns in screening results (e.g., a certain number of consecutive non-relevant items without a formal link to overall performance) without explicit reference to to achieving a specific performance target. A Stopping Method is considered Target-aware if the decision to stop the Priority Screening process is directly based on an evaluation of whether a predefined performance goal has been met. This typically involves: (i) estimating a specific performance metric (e.g., recall, precision, F1-score) based on the documents reviewed so far, (ii) comparing this estimated metric against a pre-set target value for that metric (e.g., "stop if estimated recall is at least 95%") or against a threshold that was mathematically derived to achieve a specific performance level. This is distinct from stopping based purely on resource limits (e.g., number of documents screened, time spent) or on observed screening patterns not explicitly tied to an overall performance target (e.g., a fixed number of consecutive non-relevant items found without linking that number to a specific recall guarantee)

A Target-Aware stopping condition is also Uncertainty-Aware if, when evaluating whether the predefined performance goal has been met, it explicitly incorporates a measure of statistical uncertainty about the estimated performance metric into the stopping decision. This means it doesn't just rely on the single best guess (point estimate) of current performance. Instead, it also considers the reliability or precision of that estimate (e.g., by using confidence intervals around the estimated recall or the variance of an estimate). The decision to stop is then influenced not only by whether the performance estimate meets the target, but also by the level of statistical confidence that the target has truly been achieved at that point. A Target-Aware stopping condition is Uncertainty-Agnostic if it makes the stopping decision based solely on the point estimate of the performance metric compared against the target (e.g., simply checking 'is the current estimated recall â¥ 0.95?'). It does not dynamically use any quantified measure of statistical uncertainty about that performance estimate during the runtime evaluation of the stopping rule. Even if uncertainty principles were used to, for example, derive some hyperparameters of the method beforehand, if uncertainty around the performance estimate computed during the Priority Screening process is not part of the stopping decision itself, the condition is uncertainty-agnostic

Priority Screening is a strategy employed in literature review processes (including systematic reviews and eDiscovery) where records are deliberately presented to human reviewers in a non-random order with respect to their predicted likelihood of relevance. The primary goal is to ensure that records deemed more likely to be relevant by a computational model (e.g., a machine learning classifier, a ranking algorithm) are reviewed earlier in the process than those deemed less likely to be relevant. While Priority Screening often does involve presenting records in a strictly descending order of predicted relevance (which I refer to as "Ranked Screening", which as a type of Priority Screenin), I consider Priority Screening to also encompasses strategies such as those where the order is probabilistically biased towards higher-relevance predictions or where records are presented in batches sampled from different strata of predicted relevance (e.g., sampling more heavily from high-probability strata). The defining characteristic is the intentional effort to prioritise potentially relevant records, not necessarily a rigid, unbroken sequence from highest to lowest score.
